<b>I don’t wanna hear your scolding anymore.</b>

<b>Don't be over dramatic okay?</b>

<b>Yes i am</b>

<b> But</b>

50
00:02:50,383 --> 00:02:51,800
<b>What is it to you?</b>

51
00:02:52,483 --> 00:02:54,599
<b>How many times do I need to say and repeat it?!</b>

52
00:02:55,083 --> 00:02:56,966
<b>Your relationship with Keifer is a sin!</b>

53
00:02:57,183 --> 00:02:58,650
<b>It’s a sin against God’s eyes!</b>

54
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:01,250
<b>I get what your trying to say mom!</b>

55
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:04,683
<b>You kept telling it to me every single time</b>

56
00:03:05,083 --> 00:03:06,500
<b>But that doesn't change the fact</b>

<b>That i still love Him!</b>

58
00:03:10,166 --> 00:03:11,516
<b>(*Shocked*) Are you hearing yourself right now?!</b>

62
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:15,750
<b>But!?</b>

00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:38,300
<b>May i have your advice</b>

72
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:40,383
<b>Yes, What is it? Something bothering you?</b>

73
00:03:40,449 --> 00:03:40,916
<b>Yes</b>

74
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,800
<b>Is it love life?</b>

75
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:43,300
<b>Yes</b>

76
00:03:44,849 --> 00:03:45,900
<b>Its about that "Guy"</b>

77
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:49,033
<b>That Guy" the one that you have telling me </b>

<b>A million times already</b>

<b>Yes</b>

80
00:03:52,066 --> 00:03:54,500
<b> His mother is against our relationship.</b>

81
00:03:54,699 --> 00:03:55,883
<b>Well may i know why?</b>

82
00:03:56,633 --> 00:03:59,283
<b>His mom is a religious person</b>

83
00:03:59,533 --> 00:04:00,349
<b>And</b>

84
00:04:01,433 --> 00:04:03,516
<b>And she says that it is a sin</b>

85
00:04:05,566 --> 00:04:06,266
<b> Uh huh…</b>

86
00:04:06,533 --> 00:04:07,483
<b>Well son  </b>

87
00:04:07,483 --> 00:04:08,300
<b>in this world</b>

88
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:10,866
<b>Everyone has a different perspectives and beliefs</b>

89
00:04:10,866 --> 00:04:13,866
<b>You can’t really change someone's mindset, right?</b>


90
00:04:14,366 --> 00:04:15,750
<b>I get your point dad</b>

91
00:04:15,916 --> 00:04:17,783
<b>But its her own  beliefs</b>

92
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:18,916
<b>And</b>

93
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,300
<b>I think that She should not force on us.</b>

94
00:04:21,616 --> 00:04:24,333
<b>And We are old enough, to make our own decisions</b>

95
00:04:24,533 --> 00:04:25,116
<b>Right?</b>

96
00:04:27,533 --> 00:04:32,733
<b>Son,  I also get your point. But hear me out. You know that I support both you and Yuri, right?</b>

97
00:04:33,566 --> 00:04:34,583
<b>Yes</b>

98
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:41,183
<b>Right. I’m not defending Yuri’s mother, but she has the right to be against your relationship.</b>

99
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:45,550
<b>You’ve mentioned that she is a religious person, so what can you expect?</b>

100
00:04:45,716 --> 00:04:51,483
<b>They believe that God only created men and women. A man is only for women, and women is only for men</b>

101
00:04:51,483 --> 00:04:54,183
<b>Just like what Genesis 1:27 says</b>

102
00:04:55,166 --> 00:04:55,750
<b>Dad</b>

103
00:04:56,116 --> 00:04:57,633
<b>I dont get your point</b>

104
00:04:57,899 --> 00:04:59,699
<b>I'm a human i have feelings</b>

105
00:05:00,083 --> 00:05:01,149
<b>I love yuri</b>

106
00:05:01,149 --> 00:05:02,383
<b>I love Him</b>

107
00:05:02,716 --> 00:05:04,000
<b>No because of His gender</b>

108
00:05:04,716 --> 00:05:05,199
<b>But</b>

109
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:06,366
<b>Because of</b>

110
00:05:07,149 --> 00:05:08,783
<b>For who He is</b>

111
00:05:08,966 --> 00:05:09,750
<b>Do you get me?</b>

112
00:05:09,899 --> 00:05:11,183
<b>I get your side son</b>

113
00:05:11,366 --> 00:05:13,083
<b>But lets face reality</b>

114
00:05:13,083 --> 00:05:17,183
<b>Like what I’ve said earlier, you can’t force your belief on someone else.</b>

115
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:20,516
<b>Everyone has a different perspective and belief's.</b>

116
00:05:20,866 --> 00:05:23,300
<b>What matters is that we respect each other, right?</b>

117
00:05:23,683 --> 00:05:24,699
<b>Yes dad</b>

118
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:25,149
<b>but</b>

119
00:05:25,733 --> 00:05:26,699
<b>I dont think that</b>

120
00:05:27,316 --> 00:05:30,316
<b>I'll-  I can keep my distance from him</b>

121
00:05:31,033 --> 00:05:32,000
<b>You know?</b>

122
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,366
<b>His Mom wants us to break up and never associate again!</b>

123
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:38,266
<b>Give it a time son</b>

124
00:05:38,266 --> 00:05:40,533
<b>Don’t rush in making decisions</b>

125
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,500
<b>I know that you’ll be able to figure it out</b>

126
00:05:43,833 --> 00:05:46,233
<b>Plus, you could talk to me when you need help, right?</b>

127
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:47,833
<b>*sigh*</b>

128
00:05:48,833 --> 00:05:49,766
<b>Yes dad</b>

129
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:50,933

<b>Have you heard anything about Yuri?</b>

136
00:06:03,533 --> 00:06:07,266
<b>Well, I haven’t seen him much except when we have classes together.</b>

137
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:08,449
<b>Im worried sick</b>

138
00:06:08,449 --> 00:06:10,933
<b>He hasn't chatted me or called me yet</b>

<b>Is someone bothering or threatening you?</b>

188
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:49,366
<b>No, it’s not for me. It’s for my son.</b>

189
00:07:49,366 --> 00:07:52,366
<b>Really? so is there someone who's threatening your son?</b>

<b>Can you tell me exactly why you want to file a restraining order against him?</b>

194
00:08:05,699 --> 00:08:09,233
<b>Do you really need the details? I just want him gone from my son's life!</b>

195
00:08:09,649 --> 00:08:12,100
<b>I don’t want them associating with each other!</b>

196
00:08:12,433 --> 00:08:15,433
<b>I’m sorry Florence, but if you don’t give me a specific reason</b>

197
00:08:15,666 --> 00:08:18,666
<b>I can not help you with this What even is his name?</b>

198
00:08:18,883 --> 00:08:21,883

00:08:24,899 --> 00:08:28,250
<b>Your son? What? No way…</b>

<b>He is! My one and only Keifer Velvetine! So you’re that boyfriend’s mother he’s been talking about!</b>

202
00:08:34,283 --> 00:08:34,883
<b>What?</b>

203
00:08:34,883 --> 00:08:36,833
<b>What mother are you talking about?</b>

204
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:41,416
<b>You’re the mother of his boyfriend! Yuri! Yuri Haruka!</b>

205
00:08:42,299 --> 00:08:48,066
<b>No way… So why aren’t you trying to separate them both! You knew about their relationship!</b>

206
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:51,250
<b>Alright, let’s get back why you are here in the first place.</b>

207
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:56,516
<b>you want to get a restraining order for your son against his boyfriend?  No, I can not help you with tat.</b>

208
00:08:57,683 --> 00:09:00,350
<b>What? What do you mean by that?</b>

209
00:09:00,483 --> 00:09:04,766
<b>You’re a lawyer aren’t you? What’s the purpose of your job if you’re not able to help me?</b>

210
00:09:04,933 --> 00:09:10,733
<b>Don’t you know that you could have serious consequences when you’re trying to file a restraining order without valid reason?</b>


211
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:13,783
<b>This is considered as an abuse of the legal system! </b>

212
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:17,366
<b>Which can result in penalties and even criminal charges!</b>


213
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:19,233
<b>This is absurd!</b>

214
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:22,583
<b> Florence, I know that you have a strong relationship towards God</b>

215
00:09:22,583 --> 00:09:28,083
<b>And you know that I respect that, but please, let the kids be happy. They can decide for themselves!</b>

216
00:09:28,516 --> 00:09:31,516
<b>Are you even hearing yourself right now, Alejandro?!</b>

217
00:09:32,116 --> 00:09:35,116
<b>Florence, please calm down! Think about it!</b>
